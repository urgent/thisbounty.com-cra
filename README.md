## Core business

Programming computers.

## What problem am I trying to solve?

The hidden pitfalls of programming computers. Often the manual and marketing does not tell the full story. thisbounty.com offers a compelling software knowledge base to increase the amount of people in the world who have "done it before."

## Principles

1. Done it before: Experience. First build internal tools. Then launch proven solutions as products to the market.
2. No customs: Make it look like the manual as close as possible.
3. Goals: Create, track with a strong and defined focus.
4. Focus on the core business: How does it make money? How do I get paid? Finance markets are the wisest ones of us all.
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech.
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware.
7. Fix bugs, add features: Don't start with "change the world". First find an existing problem and fix it.
8. No hot fixes: Scrambling upon launch and go live is a sign of a bad plan. Scrap the entire thing.
9. Use IDEs and version control instead of inner platforms.
10. Users expect robust features: If the user wants a sort, and there's no sort, dump data to Excel and scrap your custom work.
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort.
12. Quick launch: Even if it's just a newsletter signup.
13. Do not pay for advertising: Get clients instead, and share.
14. Walk away: Leave it for others to build. Be happy it got built. Sometimes it's the fastest way.

## User Persona

Software programmers who work an hour or two a day, who see earning money as healthy, and the market as the final judge of skill.

## What problems am I not trying to solve, and why?

### Bug bounties

The exact opposite of what I want. Open ended, arbitrary. I want software kan ban. Repeated, clearly defined work.

### Freelance market fees, signup, finding leads, competition, and siloed production

The origin of the site's name and motto. Freelance is a crowded market already. Too much work to launch. Not that big of a deal to pay the fee and find work. Current setup is non-intuitive, and requires direct instruction. Market leaders have separate channels, like research university or hiring direct in workforce.

### Automate mundane tasks. Github repo. Netlify launch. Figma style guide

If there was an easier way, those platforms would do it already. Too much work to ingest all the data, and build a model for scoring health based on github commits or figma activity.

### Standard operating procedures

Too many different approaches. Every product is different.

### Automate payments on passing unit tests

A security nightmare. Easier to pay people regardless.

## Application of thisbounty.com

1. Done it before: `Building internal tool first on my time and dime. Doing it now :)`
2. No customs: `Threw my webrtc p2p graphql misadventure into the dumpster.`
3. Create and track goals: `If this isn't built on 25th February, it's dead on 26th February`
4. Focus on the core business: `Make money direct from clients. Building this knowledge base is their "done it before".`
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech. `See Rules`
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware. `Doing it before. Eventually, a public facing app for users to commission work. Bounty scoring is going to be tough. Hasura host. React frontend. FA icons. Custom knowledge base, goal setting, ...`
7. Fix bugs, add features: `Bug: experience. Feature: core business knowledge base`
8. No hot fixes: `Not live, no users`
9. Use IDEs and version control instead of inner platforms. `Only industry standard platforms, no customs`
10. Users expect robust features: `Starting with name and health only`
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort. `Scrapped figma, diez, storybook, novel p2p graphql sourcing. Not afraid to scrap project. Keeping features minimal`
12. Quick launch: `Launched with an excel sheet`
13. Do not pay for advertising: `Finding clients`
14. Walk away: `Left decentralization behind`

## Rules

1. Three strikes, and your bounty is out.
2. What's a strike? Problem. Roadblock. Haven't done it before. Anything that delays launch.
3. Launched something with it? Get an extra at-bat.
4. If you're out, retry with a more basic approach. For instance, DOM instead of React, or API instead of GraphQL.
5. Money, users, resources, links per discretion. People read them though.

## Navigation

1. Bounties can have leads, specific independent tasks. Click a bounty to see the leads.
2. Leads can have bounties of their own. Click a lead to see the bounties.
3. Escape back home by clicking the top bounty with the "one up" navigation symbol.
4. Edit values through pgadmin until public release.

## Public Release

1. Click "New" to create a new bounty. Type in name.
2. Click bounty, then click "New" to create a lead.
3. Bad bounties or leads strike out on their own. Move on. Leave your mistakes.
4. Click "Share" to let other people know about your bounty.
5. Click an attribute, then click "Sort" to sort bounties.
6. Click "Search" to search bounties and leads by keyword.
7. Chat drops to Discord.
8. Bomb shows dissastisfcation. Repeatitive clicks lead to easter eggs.

# CRA Boilerplate:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
