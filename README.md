## Core business

Programming computers.

## What problem am I trying to solve?

I have free time. I have computer programming knowledge. What do I do with it?

Think of picking a sport. Instead of being dead set on the next Michael Jordan, get in really good shape, try every sport, and let the sport pick you.

## User Journey

Website visitor lands on thisbounty.com

Visitor clicks on one of the products.

Website drills down. Elements stay the same. New lists.

1. Churn: Working for free, ready to say no.
2. Flip: Looking to hire or move, about to say no.
3. Salvage: Said no, recapturing value.
4. No catch, no pay: Working for real. Burn the boats.

## Guidance

1. Done it before: Experience. First build internal tools. Then launch proven solutions as products to the market.
   At some point, every job is different. When building software, responsible for every feature, and every new problem. Markets change faster than experience builds. Never underestimate the amount of work involved.
2. No customs: Make it look like the manual as close as possible. Be wary of domain specific business logic. Look at that first.
3. Goals: Create, track with a strong and defined focus. Daily and long term. Concrete goals.
4. Focus on the core business: How does it make money? How do I get paid?
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech.
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware.
7. Fix bugs, add features: Don't start with "change the world". First find an existing problem and fix it.
8. No hot fixes: Scrap the entire thing on unforseen problems. Don't want to solve one problem only to create two more.
9. Use spreadsheets, IDEs, version control, database admins, monitoring, alerts instead of custom admins and inner platforms.
10. Users expect robust features: If the user wants a sort, and there's no sort, dump data to Excel and scrap your custom work.
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort.
12. Quick launch: Even if it's just a newsletter signup.
13. Do not pay for advertising: Get clients instead, and share.
14. Walk away: Leave it for others to build. Be happy it got built. Sometimes it's the fastest way.

## What problems am I not trying to solve, and why?

### Bug bounties

Open ended, arbitrary.

### Freelance market fees, signup, finding leads, competition, and siloed production

Crowded market already. Too much work for launch. Easier to pay the fee. Market leaders avoid freelance, hire direct and use research universities.

### Automate mundane tasks. Github repo. Netlify launch. Figma style guide

If there was an easier way, those platforms would do it already. Too much work to ingest all the data, and build a model for scoring health based on github commits or figma activity.

### Standard operating procedures

Too many different approaches. Every product is different.

### Automate payments on passing unit tests

Security nightmare. Easier to pay people.

### Done it before, building experience

Enough experience already. Now in specific domain knowledge.

## Application of thisbounty.com

1. Done it before: `Yes.`
2. No customs: `React, Relay, Hasura, Netlify. What are the domains, and required business intelligence for churn, flip, salvage, and no catch no pay?`
3. Goals: `See goals. Are goals concrete and clear? Tracking? Daily and long term. How to evaluate?`
4. Focus on the core business: `Churn, flip, salvage, and no catch no pay.`
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech. `See Rules`
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware. `See ARCHITECTURE.md`
7. Fix bugs, add features: `Bug: Knowledge, free time, no work. Feature: Navigation of available work.`
8. No hot fixes: `Scrapped leads, categories. One UI component. Churn to promote saying no.`
9. Use spreadsheets, IDEs and version control instead of inner platforms. `No frontend mutations. Change through Hasura`
10. Users expect robust features: `Visualization only. Add through Hasura. May add identity for users to comission work.`
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort. `Keeping features minimal. Not afraid to scrap entire thing. Flip and salvage for scrapped projects.`
12. Quick launch: `Launched with an excel sheet. Need quick way to comission work. Login, and click bomb button. That's it.`
13. Do not pay for advertising: `Finding clients on existing platforms.`
14. Walk away: `Left decentralization behind. Churn, flip and salvage promote walk away.`

## Rules

1. Read this first on start of new workday.
2. Growth: 10 new bids prior to work on thisbounty.com
3. No surprises: Work for free before agreeing to terms. State that in bid to increase conversions.
4. Time: Keep an itinerary before work. Use clockify.
5. Track: At close, reflect on each workday. Keep a list of goals. Work backwards from deadline.
6. Plan: After reflection, visualize next workday
7. Focus: Pomodoro on while working, no exceptions
8. Perfection: If it's not perfect, get rid of it, move on
9. Churn, flip, and salvage.

## Navigation

Click a bounty. Work appears by drilling.

Login with identity provider. Click bomb. Stays on in alarm until I contact back. How to scale that up eventually? No contact. Bulk assign to churn? How to one piece flow that?

TTL? Allow community to pick up? Click new lead, then bomb button it to keep it alive? Assign a wallet. Pay to it? Assign a metric, update users?

## Public Release

## Past Work

### 2/26

Goals:

"done it before"

What have I "done before":

- React components, and create react app
- Styled components
- Hasura
- Relay Query Render
- Relay Subscriptions
- Jest, Red/Green refactor
- Netlify serverless functions

What haven't I "done before":

- SASS
- Business Logic
- Relay Fragments
- Dates

Get a client

- Orlando Magic website
- landbot, project storm
- Draft Card

Found them, got them, couldn't keep them. Too much work for too little money.

## CRA Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
