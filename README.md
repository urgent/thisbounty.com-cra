## What problem am I trying to solve?

Compelling software knowledge base. Discover the hidden pitfalls of programming computers.

## Principles

1. Experience: I've done it before. Internal tools first. Product launch second.
2. No customs: Make it look like the manual as close as possible.
3. Create and track goals: Strong and defined focus.
4. Focus on the core business: How does it make money? How do I get paid? Finance markets are the wisest ones of us all.
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech.
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware.
7. Fix bugs. Add features: Don't start with "change the world". First find an existing problem and fix it.
8. No hot fixes: Sign of bad plan. Scrap entire thing.
9. Use IDEs and version control instead of inner platforms.
10. Users expect robust features: If the user wants a sort, and there's no sort, dump data to Excel and scrap your custom work.
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort.
12. Quick launch: Even if it's just a newsletter signup.
13. Do not pay for advertising: Get clients instead, and share.
14. Walk away: Leave it for others to build. Be happy it got built. Sometimes it's the fastest way.

## User Persona

Software programmers who work an hour or two a day, who see earning money as healthy, and the market as the final judge of skill.

## What problems am I not trying to solve, and why?

### Bug bounties

The exact opposite of what I want. Open ended, arbitrary. I want software kan ban. Repeated, clearly defined work.

### Freelance market fees, signup, finding leads, competition, and siloed production

The origin of the site's name and motto. Freelance is a crowded market already. Too much work to launch. Not that big of a deal to pay the fee and find work. Market leaders have separate channels.

### Automate mundane tasks. Github repo. Netlify launch. Figma style guide

If there was an easier way, those platforms would do it already. Too much work to ingest all the data, and build a model for scoring.

### Standard operating procedures

Too many different approaches. Every product is different.

### Automate payments on passing unit tests

A security nightmare. Easier to pay people regardless.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
