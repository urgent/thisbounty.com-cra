## Core business

Programming computers.

## What problem am I trying to solve?

Computer programming experience. "done it before". Take an entire project from start to finish, so there are no surprises when working for future clients.

Features:

1. Personal workspace: Fast response to clients, test and preview new features.
2. Frontend, server, build, platforms: Provisioned, internal tools ready to use on new projects.
3. Test leading technology: Something new launches, have the infrastructure to try it out before using it for clients.
4. Potential sales: Start with a broad sales funnel, maybe even negative, spend to find context and intent, convert to client.

## Principles

1. Done it before: Experience. First build internal tools. Then launch proven solutions as products to the market.
2. No customs: Make it look like the manual as close as possible.
3. Goals: Create, track with a strong and defined focus.
4. Focus on the core business: How does it make money? How do I get paid?
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech.
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware.
7. Fix bugs, add features: Don't start with "change the world". First find an existing problem and fix it.
8. No hot fixes: Scrap the entire thing on unforseen problems. Don't want to solve one problem only to create two more.
9. Use spreadsheets, IDEs, version control, database admins, monitoring, alerts instead of custom admins and inner platforms.
10. Users expect robust features: If the user wants a sort, and there's no sort, dump data to Excel and scrap your custom work.
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort.
12. Quick launch: Even if it's just a newsletter signup.
13. Do not pay for advertising: Get clients instead, and share.
14. Walk away: Leave it for others to build. Be happy it got built. Sometimes it's the fastest way.

## User Persona

Computer programmers who need experience.

## What problems am I not trying to solve, and why?

### Bug bounties

Open ended, arbitrary.

### Freelance market fees, signup, finding leads, competition, and siloed production

Crowded market already. Too much work for launch. Easier to pay the fee. Market leaders avoid freelance, hire direct and use research universities.

### Automate mundane tasks. Github repo. Netlify launch. Figma style guide

If there was an easier way, those platforms would do it already. Too much work to ingest all the data, and build a model for scoring health based on github commits or figma activity.

### Standard operating procedures

Too many different approaches. Every product is different.

### Automate payments on passing unit tests

Security nightmare. Easier to pay people.

## Application of thisbounty.com

1. Done it before: `Core tech done before. Build experience with this project.`
2. No customs: `React, relay, styled-components. Removed relay experimental. No next.js, too many cross cuts`
3. Goals: `Deadline of 26th February for "done it before".`
4. Focus on the core business: `Build experience for future clients`
5. Build clear rules outside of the tech. `See Rules`
6. List everything not core business. At least you are aware. `See ARCHITECTURE.md`
7. Fix bugs, add features: `Bug: Haven't "done it before." Feature: Provisioning when clicking bounty.`
8. No hot fixes: `Focus on "done it before" Then worry about conversions`
9. Use spreadsheets, IDEs and version control instead of inner platforms. `No frontend mutations. Change through Hasura`
10. Users expect robust features: `Visualization only. No conversion`
11. Either don't do it, or do it full effort. `Keeping features minimal. Not afraid to scrap entire thing`
12. Quick launch: `Launched with an excel sheet`
13. Do not pay for advertising: `Finding clients`
14. Walk away: `Left decentralization behind`

## Rules

1. Read this first on start of new workday.
2. Growth: 5 new bids prior to work on thisbounty.com
3. No surprises: Work for free before agreeing to terms. State that in bid to increase conversions.
4. Time: Keep an itinerary before work
5. Track: At close, reflect on each workday. Keep a list of goals. Work backwards from deadline.
6. Plan: After reflection, visualize next workday
7. Focus: Pomodoro on while working, no exceptions
8. Perfection: If it's not perfect, get rid of it, move on

## Navigation

Click a bounty. Provision resources popup, like Hasura does with Heroku

## Public Release

2/26, hire someone to work on thisbounty.com

Actions, start with text chat on left side when clicking goals, principles.

Move onto provisioning, like Hasura does with Heroku.

If someone wants new work, they can open an issue on github. Make sure I'm notified.

## CRA Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
